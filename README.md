# My Awesome Chatbot Project: GPT-4 and Rule-Based

Yo, so for this project, I built a chatbot! It's got two modes: one uses the super smart GPT-4 (through this thing called RapidAPI), and the other uses a bunch of rules I set up. The rule-based one is kinda like a backup, or for when you need to handle specific customer support stuff.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Application

Basically, the goal of this app is to make a chatbot that can handle all sorts of conversations, from simple stuff to more complex, in-depth discussions. Here's what I wanted it to do:

* Make a chatbot that can chat in a natural way using the GPT-4 API.
* Create a rule-based chatbot that can answer common customer support questions quickly and accurately.
* Make a system that can switch between the GPT-4 chatbot and the rule-based one, depending on what's needed.
* Build a chatbot that's reliable and can be used in other applications.
* Keep a record of the chat interactions.

### 1.2 Brief Overview of Chosen Project

So, this project is all about designing and building a chatbot app using Python. The app uses the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API via RapidAPI for the really smart conversations, and I also added a rule-based system for those everyday questions. I used object-oriented programming to structure the app, with different classes for each chatbot type, a factory to create the chatbots, and a session manager to keep track of the chat history.

## 2. Problem Definition and Requirements

### 2.1 Description of the Problem Your Application Solves

A lot of businesses and people need ways to handle questions and provide support efficiently.  Using humans can be expensive, and they can't be available 24/7.  This app tries to solve this by providing an automated chatbot that can:

* Give instant responses.
* Handle lots of conversations at once.
* Be available all the time.
* Take some of the load off of human agents.
* Provide a consistent experience for users.

### 2.2 Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Functional Requirements

* **Chatbot Interaction:** Users should be able to chat with the chatbot using text.
* **GPT-4 Integration:** The app needs to use the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API via RapidAPI for those smart responses.
* **Rule-Based Responses:** The app should have pre-set answers for common customer support situations.
* **Chat History:** The app needs to keep track of the conversation between the user and the chatbot.
* **Chatbot Selection:** The app should be able to choose between the GPT-4 chatbot and the rule-based chatbot.
* **History Management:** The app should be able to save and load chat histories.

#### 2.2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

* **Reliability:** The app should be reliable and give consistent responses.
* **Scalability:** It should be able to handle a bunch of users at the same time.
* **Maintainability:** The app should be easy to maintain and update in the future.
* **Security:** It needs to handle API keys and sensitive data securely.
* **Usability:** The app should be easy to use and understand.

## 3. Design and Implementation

### 3.1 Object-Oriented Design Principles Used

I used these object-oriented principles when designing the app:

* **Abstraction:** The `Chatbot` class is like a blueprint for all chatbot types, so you don't need to know the specifics of how each one works.
* **Inheritance:** The `GPT4Chatbot` and `CustomerSupportChatbot` classes inherit stuff from the `Chatbot` class, which makes the code reusable and organized.
* **Polymorphism:** The `respond` method is defined in the `Chatbot` class, but the `GPT4Chatbot` and `CustomerSupportChatbot` classes can have their own versions of it to respond in their own way.
* **Factory Pattern:** The `ChatbotFactory` class is responsible for creating the chatbot objects.  This makes it easy to switch between different chatbot types.
* **Singleton Pattern:** The `ChatSession` class makes sure that there's only one instance of the chat session manager.

### 3.2 Class Diagrams and Structure

\[Class Diagram - Include a class diagram here. You can use a tool like PlantUML to generate this and include the code here, or describe the structure in detail. A basic PlantUML example is below, but you'll need to adapt it\]

    @startuml
    abstract class Chatbot {
    +respond(message: str, context: str = None): str
    }
    class GPT4Chatbot {
    -rapidapi_key: str
    -api_url: str
    -headers: dict
    -conversation_history: list
    -model_name: str
    -max_tokens: int
    -temperature: float
    +respond(message: str, context: str = None): str
    }
    class CustomerSupportChatbot {
    +respond(message: str, context: str = None): str
    }
    class ChatbotFactory {
    +create_chatbot(type: str, rapidapi_key: str = None): Chatbot
    }
    class ChatSession {
    -_instance: ChatSession
    -_history: list
    +add_to_history(message: str, response: str): void
    +save_history(filename: str): void
    +load_history(filename: str): void
    +history: list
    }

#### Class Descriptions

* **Chatbot:** This is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all chatbot classes. It declares the `respond` method, which is responsible for generating a response to a given user message.
* **GPT4Chatbot:** This class implements the `Chatbot` interface and provides functionality for interacting with the GPT-4 Turbo API. It stores the RapidAPI key, API URL, headers, conversation history, and model parameters. The `respond` method sends the user message to the API and returns the API's response.
* **CustomerSupportChatbot:** This class implements the `Chatbot` interface and provides rule-based responses for common customer support queries. The `respond` method uses a series of conditional statements to determine the appropriate response based on the user's message.
* **ChatbotFactory:** This class implements the Factory design pattern. Its `create_chatbot` method creates and returns an instance of either the `GPT4Chatbot` or `CustomerSupportChatbot` class, depending on the specified chatbot type.
* **ChatSession:** This class implements the Singleton design pattern. It manages the history of the chat session, storing user messages and chatbot responses. It provides methods for adding to the history, saving the history to a file, and loading the history from a file.

### 3.3 Key Algorithms and Data Structures Implemented

* **GPT-4 API Interaction:**
    * The `GPT4Chatbot` class uses the `requests` library to send a POST request to the GPT-4 API.
    * The request includes the user's message, the API key, and other parameters like the model and stuff.
    * The API sends back a JSON response, and the class grabs the chatbot's response from it.
* **Rule-Based Response Selection:**
    * The `CustomerSupportChatbot` class uses a bunch of `if` and `elif` statements to see if the user's message matches any keywords or patterns.
    * If it finds a match, it returns the right response.
* **Chat History Management**
    * The `ChatSession` class uses a list (`self._history`) to store all the messages and responses.
    * The history is saved as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing the user's message and the chatbot's response.
* **Data Structures:**
    * The application mainly uses Python lists and dictionaries to store data.
    * The `conversation_history` in the `GPT4Chatbot` class is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message in the conversation.
    * The `headers` attribute in the `GPT4Chatbot` class is a dictionary that stores the HTTP headers for the API request.
    * JSON is used to save and load the chat history to/from a file.
