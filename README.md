# GPT-4 and Rule-Based Chatbot

This project implements a chatbot with two modes: a powerful GPT-4 based chatbot (using the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API via RapidAPI) and a rule-based chatbot that serves as a fallback or handles specific customer support scenarios.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Application

The primary purpose of this application is to provide a versatile chatbot solution capable of handling user interactions with varying levels of complexity.  The objectives include:

* Developing a chatbot that can engage in natural language conversations using the GPT-4 API.
* Creating a rule-based chatbot to address specific customer support needs and provide quick, accurate responses to common queries.
* Designing a system that can seamlessly switch between the two chatbot modes, leveraging the strengths of each.
* Providing a robust and reliable chatbot solution that can be easily integrated into other applications.
* Creating a record of chat interactions

### 1.2 Brief Overview of Chosen Project

This project involves the design and implementation of a Python-based chatbot application.  The application utilizes the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API through RapidAPI for advanced conversational capabilities and incorporates a rule-based system for handling routine inquiries.  The application is structured using object-oriented principles, with separate classes for each chatbot type, a factory for chatbot creation, and a session manager for maintaining chat history.

## 2. Problem Definition and Requirements

### 2.1 Description of the Problem Your Application Solves

Many businesses and individuals require efficient and scalable solutions for handling user inquiries and providing support.  Traditional methods, such as human agents, can be costly and may not be available 24/7.  This application addresses this problem by providing an automated chatbot solution that can:

* Provide instant responses to user queries.
* Handle a large volume of interactions.
* Offer 24/7 availability.
* Reduce the workload on human agents.
* Provide a consistent and reliable user experience.

### 2.2 Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Functional Requirements

* **Chatbot Interaction:** The application must allow users to interact with the chatbot through a text-based interface.
* **GPT-4 Integration:** The application must integrate with the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API via RapidAPI to provide intelligent and context-aware responses.
* **Rule-Based Responses:** The application must provide predefined responses for specific customer support scenarios.
* **Chat History:** The application must maintain a history of user and chatbot interactions.
* **Chatbot Selection:** The application must be able to select between the GPT-4 chatbot and the rule-based chatbot.
* **History Management:** The application must be able to save and load chat histories.

#### 2.2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

* **Reliability:** The application must be reliable and provide consistent responses.
* **Scalability:** The application should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users.
* **Maintainability:** The application should be designed in a modular and well-documented manner to facilitate future maintenance and updates.
* **Security:** The application must handle API keys and sensitive data securely.
* **Usability:** The application should be easy to use and provide a clear and intuitive user experience.

## 3. Design and Implementation

### 3.1 Object-Oriented Design Principles Used

The application is designed using the following object-oriented principles:

* **Abstraction:** The `Chatbot` class provides an abstract interface for all chatbot types, hiding the specific implementation details.
* **Inheritance:** The `GPT4Chatbot` and `CustomerSupportChatbot` classes inherit from the `Chatbot` class, allowing them to reuse common functionality and provide specialized behavior.
* **Polymorphism:** The `respond` method is defined in the `Chatbot` base class and overridden in the derived classes, allowing different chatbot types to respond to messages in their own way.
* **Factory Pattern:** The `ChatbotFactory` class implements the Factory pattern, encapsulating the chatbot creation logic and allowing the application to easily switch between chatbot types.
* **Singleton Pattern:** The `ChatSession` class implements the Singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of the chat session manager exists.

### 3.2 Class Diagrams and Structure

#### Class Descriptions

* **Chatbot:** This is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all chatbot classes.  It declares the `respond` method, which is responsible for generating a response to a given user message.
* **GPT4Chatbot:** This class implements the `Chatbot` interface and provides functionality for interacting with the GPT-4 Turbo API.  It stores the RapidAPI key, API URL, headers, conversation history, and model parameters.  The `respond` method sends the user message to the API and returns the API's response.
* **CustomerSupportChatbot:** This class implements the `Chatbot` interface and provides rule-based responses for common customer support queries.  The `respond` method uses a series of conditional statements to determine the appropriate response based on the user's message.
* **ChatbotFactory:** This class implements the Factory design pattern.  Its `create_chatbot` method creates and returns an instance of either the `GPT4Chatbot` or `CustomerSupportChatbot` class, depending on the specified chatbot type.
* **ChatSession:** This class implements the Singleton design pattern.  It manages the history of the chat session, storing user messages and chatbot responses.  It provides methods for adding to the history, saving the history to a file, and loading the history from a file.

### 3.3 Key Algorithms and Data Structures Implemented

* **GPT-4 API Interaction:**
    * The `GPT4Chatbot` class uses the `requests` library to send a POST request to the GPT-4 API.
    * The request includes the user's message, the API key, and other parameters such as the model name, maximum tokens, and temperature.
    * The API returns a JSON response, which the class parses to extract the chatbot's response.
* **Rule-Based Response Selection:**
    * The `CustomerSupportChatbot` class uses a series of `if` and `elif` statements to match the user's message against a set of predefined keywords and patterns.
    * When a match is found, the corresponding response is returned.
* **Chat History Management**
    * The `ChatSession` class uses a list (`self._history`) to store the history of messages and responses.
    * The history is stored as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the user's message and the chatbot's response.
* **Data Structures:**
    * The application primarily uses Python lists and dictionaries to store and manipulate data.
    * The `conversation_history` in the `GPT4Chatbot` class is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message in the conversation.
    * The `headers` attribute in the `GPT4Chatbot` class is a dictionary that stores the HTTP headers for the API request.
    * JSON is used to serialize and deserialize the chat history when saving to and loading from a file.
