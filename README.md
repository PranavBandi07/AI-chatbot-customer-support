# CustomerSupport AI ChatBot
This project is all about building a chatbot application, and it's got two main ways of doing its thing. First, there's a GPT-4 powered chatbot, which uses the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API through RapidAPI. Then, there's a rule-based chatbot. The rule-based one is there to handle specific customer support scenarios and serves as a backup for GPT-4.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Application

The whole point of this application is to create a chatbot solution that's pretty versatile. It's designed to handle user interactions, whether they're super simple or really complex. Here's what I was aiming for with this project:

* To develop a chatbot that can have pretty natural conversations, and to do that, I'm using the GPT-4 API, which is known for its advanced conversational abilities.
* To create a rule-based chatbot. This chatbot will be able to give accurate responses to common questions, which is super useful for customer support.
* To design a system that can switch between the two chatbot modes without any issues. This makes the application more flexible, because it can use the best mode for any given situation.
* To develop a chatbot solution that's not only robust and reliable but also easy to integrate into other applications.
* To keep a record of all the chat interactions. This could be really useful for analyzing conversations and improving the chatbot in the future.

### 1.2 Brief Overview of Chosen Project

This project involves designing and building a chatbot application using Python. The application uses the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API via RapidAPI for those more complex, advanced conversations. For the more routine stuff, it uses a rule-based system. I decided to structure the application using object-oriented principles, which means creating separate classes for each chatbot type, a factory for creating the chatbots, and a session manager for keeping track of the chat history.

## 2. Problem Definition and Requirements

### 2.1 Description of the Problem the Application Addresses

A lot of businesses and individuals need ways to manage user inquiries and provide support without spending a ton of money or requiring staff to be available 24/7. This application tries to solve this problem by providing an automated chatbot solution. Here are some of its key capabilities:

* Providing immediate responses to user queries. This ensures that users get help right away, without having to wait.
* Handling a high volume of concurrent interactions. This means the application can handle lots of users at the same time, which is important for scalability.
* Offering continuous availability (24/7). Users can access support whenever they need it, regardless of the time of day.
* Reducing the workload on human agents. By handling routine inquiries, the chatbot allows human agents to focus on more complex and demanding issues.
* Providing a consistent and reliable user experience. All users will receive the same level of support, no matter who they are or when they interact with the chatbot.

### 2.2 Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Functional Requirements

* **Chatbot Interaction:** Users should be able to interact with the chatbot through a text-based interface.
* **GPT-4 Integration:** The application needs to integrate with the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API via RapidAPI. This is essential for enabling the chatbot to provide intelligent and context-aware responses.
* **Rule-Based Responses:** The application must provide predefined responses for specific customer support scenarios.
* **Chat History:** The application needs to keep a record of all user and chatbot interactions.
* **Chatbot Selection:** The application must be able to select between the GPT-4 chatbot and the rule-based chatbot, depending on the situation.
* **History Management:** The application should be able to save and load chat histories.

#### 2.2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

* **Reliability:** The application needs to be reliable, consistently providing accurate and appropriate responses.
* **Scalability:** The application should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users without any significant performance issues.
* **Maintainability:** The application should have a modular design and be well-documented. This will make it easier to maintain and update in the future.
* **Security:** The application must handle API keys and other sensitive data securely, protecting it from unauthorized access.
* **Usability:** The application should be easy to use, with a clear and intuitive user experience.

## 3. Design and Implementation

### 3.1 Object-Oriented Design Principles Used

The application's design is based on these object-oriented principles:

* **Abstraction:** The `Chatbot` class provides a simplified interface for all chatbot types. This abstraction hides the complex implementation details of each chatbot, making the overall design cleaner and easier to work with.
* **Inheritance:** The `GPT4Chatbot` and `CustomerSupportChatbot` classes inherit from the `Chatbot` class. This inheritance mechanism allows them to reuse common functionality, while also enabling them to provide specialized behavior as needed.
* **Polymorphism:** The `respond` method is defined in the `Chatbot` base class, but it's overridden in the derived classes. This allows the different chatbot types to respond to messages in their own unique ways.
* **Factory Pattern:** The `ChatbotFactory` class implements the Factory pattern. This pattern centralizes the chatbot creation logic, making it easier to select and create chatbot instances at runtime.
* **Singleton Pattern:** The `ChatSession` class implements the Singleton pattern. This ensures that only one instance of the chat session manager exists throughout the application's lifecycle, providing a single point of control for managing chat history.

### 3.2 Class Relationships and Interactions

The class diagram illustrates the relationships and interactions between the classes within the chatbot application.

* **Chatbot:** This is the base class, which basically lays the foundation for all the chatbot types in the application. It's an abstract class, so you can't create an instance of it directly. Instead, you have to create instances of its subclasses, which are `GPT4Chatbot` and `CustomerSupportChatbot`. The `Chatbot` class declares the `respond` method, and this is the main method for generating a chatbot's response to a user's input.
* **GPT4Chatbot:** This class inherits from `Chatbot`, and it's specifically designed to handle interactions using the GPT-4 API. To authenticate with the API, it needs a RapidAPI key. When the `respond` method is called, it sends the user's message to the GPT-4 API and then gets the API's response. This class relies on the `requests` library to make those API calls. Also, it keeps a record of the conversation history in a list, which helps it understand the context of the conversation.
* **CustomerSupportChatbot:** This class also inherits from `Chatbot`, but it works a bit differently. It provides rule-based responses to user queries. The `respond` method in this class contains the logic for matching user messages against a set of predefined rules, and based on those rules, it returns the most appropriate response. It's worth noting that this class doesn't use any external APIs; it just uses internal logic and data structures.
* **ChatbotFactory:** This class acts like a factory, and it's responsible for creating instances of either `GPT4Chatbot` or `CustomerSupportChatbot`. The specific type of chatbot instance that gets created depends on the chatbot type that's requested. By using the Factory pattern, the application centralizes all the object creation logic in this class. This makes the application more flexible and makes it easier to add new chatbot types in the future without having to change a bunch of other code. It's important to keep in mind that `ChatbotFactory` doesn't create `Chatbot` instances directly. Instead, it returns instances of classes that inherit from `Chatbot`.
* **ChatSession:** This class is in charge of managing the history of the chat session. It uses the Singleton pattern, which ensures that only one instance of `ChatSession` exists throughout the application. The `ChatSession` class stores the chat history in a list, which provides an ordered record of all the interactions. It also has methods for adding to this history, saving it to a file (using the `json` library for data serialization), and loading history from a file. While `ChatSession` doesn't inherit from `Chatbot`, it does interact with `Chatbot` instances (or, more accurately, instances of its subclasses) to record the messages that are exchanged between the user and the chatbot.

**To summarize:**

* `GPT4Chatbot` and `CustomerSupportChatbot` are specialized *types* of `Chatbot`, inheriting its basic structure and behavior.
* `ChatbotFactory` is responsible for *creating* instances of either `GPT4Chatbot` or `CustomerSupportChatbot`, depending on what the application needs.
* `ChatSession` *manages* the overall chat interaction between the user and a `Chatbot` instance (or one of its subclasses), and it also takes care of storing the history of these interactions.

### 3.3 Key Algorithms and Data Structures Implemented

* **GPT-4 API Interaction:**
    * The `GPT4Chatbot` class uses the `requests` library to send a POST request to the GPT-4 API.
    * The request includes the user's message, the API key, and any other parameters that are needed to guide the API in generating a relevant response.
    * The API sends back a JSON response, and the chatbot's response is extracted from this and then sent back to the user.
* **Rule-Based Response Selection:**
    * The `CustomerSupportChatbot` class uses a series of conditional statements to evaluate the user's message and determine if it matches any predefined keywords or patterns.
    * If a match is found, the system retrieves the corresponding predefined response and delivers it to the user.
* **Chat History Management:**
    * The `ChatSession` class uses a list, specifically `self._history`, to keep a chronological record of all the messages and responses that occur within the chat session.
    * The history is structured as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains the user's message and the chatbot's corresponding response, which ensures that the context of the conversation is preserved.
* **Data Structures:**
    * The application primarily relies on Python lists and dictionaries to store and manipulate data.
    * Within the `GPT4Chatbot` class, the `conversation_history` attribute is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in this list represents a single turn in the conversation.
    * The `headers` attribute in the `GPT4Chatbot` class is a dictionary that stores the HTTP headers required for successful communication with the GPT-4 API.
    * JSON is the format that's used for serializing and deserializing the chat history. This makes it suitable for saving to and loading from a file, which ensures that data persists across different sessions.
