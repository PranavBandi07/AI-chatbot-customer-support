# GPT-4 and Rule-Based Chatbot Application

This project implements a chatbot application with two modes of operation: a GPT-4 powered chatbot, utilizing the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API via RapidAPI, and a rule-based chatbot designed to handle specific customer support scenarios and serve as a fallback mechanism.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Application

The primary purpose of this application is to provide a versatile chatbot solution capable of managing user interactions across a spectrum of complexity. The objectives of this project are as follows:

* To develop a chatbot capable of engaging in natural language conversations, leveraging the GPT-4 API.
* To create a rule-based chatbot to address specific customer support needs and provide accurate responses to common inquiries.
* To design a system that facilitates seamless switching between the two chatbot modes, effectively utilizing the strengths of each.
* To develop a robust and reliable chatbot solution that can be readily integrated into other applications.
* To maintain a record of chat interactions.

### 1.2 Brief Overview of Chosen Project

This project involves the design and implementation of a Python-based chatbot application. The application employs the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API through RapidAPI for advanced conversational capabilities and incorporates a rule-based system for handling routine inquiries. The application is structured using object-oriented principles, with distinct classes for each chatbot type, a factory for chatbot creation, and a session manager for maintaining chat history.

## 2. Problem Definition and Requirements

### 2.1 Description of the Problem the Application Addresses

Many businesses and individuals require efficient and scalable solutions for managing user inquiries and providing support. Traditional methods, such as reliance on human agents, can be costly and may not offer 24/7 availability. This application addresses this problem by providing an automated chatbot solution with the following capabilities:

* Providing immediate responses to user queries.
* Handling a high volume of concurrent interactions.
* Offering continuous availability (24/7).
* Reducing the workload on human agents.
* Providing a consistent and reliable user experience.

### 2.2 Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Functional Requirements

* **Chatbot Interaction:** The application must enable users to interact with the chatbot through a text-based interface.
* **GPT-4 Integration:** The application must integrate with the Cheapest GPT-4 Turbo API via RapidAPI to provide intelligent and context-aware responses.
* **Rule-Based Responses:** The application must provide predefined responses for specified customer support scenarios.
* **Chat History:** The application must maintain a history of user and chatbot interactions.
* **Chatbot Selection:** The application must be capable of selecting between the GPT-4 chatbot and the rule-based chatbot.
* **History Management:** The application must be able to save and load chat histories.

#### 2.2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

* **Reliability:** The application must be reliable and provide consistent responses.
* **Scalability:** The application should be capable of handling a large number of concurrent users.
* **Maintainability:** The application should be designed in a modular and well-documented manner to facilitate future maintenance and updates.
* **Security:** The application must handle API keys and sensitive data securely.
* **Usability:** The application should be easy to use and provide a clear, intuitive user experience.

## 3. Design and Implementation

### 3.1 Object-Oriented Design Principles Used

The application is designed based on the following object-oriented principles:

* **Abstraction:** The `Chatbot` class provides an abstract interface for all chatbot types, concealing the specific implementation details of each.
* **Inheritance:** The `GPT4Chatbot` and `CustomerSupportChatbot` classes inherit from the `Chatbot` class, enabling them to reuse common functionality and provide specialized behavior.
* **Polymorphism:** The `respond` method is defined in the `Chatbot` base class and overridden in the derived classes, allowing different chatbot types to respond to messages in accordance with their specific capabilities.
* **Factory Pattern:** The `ChatbotFactory` class implements the Factory pattern, encapsulating the chatbot creation logic and facilitating the selection and instantiation of chatbot types.
* **Singleton Pattern:** The `ChatSession` class implements the Singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of the chat session manager exists throughout the application lifecycle.

### 3.2 Class Relationships and Interactions

The class diagram illustrates the relationships and interactions between the classes within the chatbot application.

* **Chatbot:** This is the base class that defines the basic structure for all chatbots. It's an abstract class, meaning you can't create an instance of it directly. Instead, you have to create instances of its subclasses (`GPT4Chatbot` and `CustomerSupportChatbot`). The `Chatbot` class declares the `respond` method, which is the core method for generating a chatbot response.

* **GPT4Chatbot:** This class inherits from `Chatbot` and is responsible for handling interactions using the GPT-4 API. It takes a RapidAPI key to authenticate with the API. When the `respond` method is called, it sends the user's message to the GPT-4 API and returns the response. It depends on the `requests` library to make the API calls. It also stores the conversation history in a list.

* **CustomerSupportChatbot:** This class also inherits from `Chatbot`. It provides rule-based responses to user queries. The `respond` method in this class contains the logic for matching user messages to predefined rules and returning the appropriate responses. It doesn't depend on any external APIs.

* **ChatbotFactory:** This class is responsible for creating instances of either `GPT4Chatbot` or `CustomerSupportChatbot` based on the chatbot type requested. It uses a factory pattern, which means that the logic for creating objects is centralized in this class. This makes it easy to add new chatbot types in the future. The `ChatbotFactory` class doesn't create `Chatbot` instances directly, but it returns instances of classes that inherit from `Chatbot`.

* **ChatSession:** This class manages the history of the chat session. It uses the Singleton pattern, which ensures that only one instance of `ChatSession` exists throughout the application. The `ChatSession` class stores the chat history in a list and provides methods for adding to the history, saving the history to a file (using the `json` library), and loading the history from a file. It doesn't inherit from `Chatbot`, but it interacts with `Chatbot` (or its subclasses) to record the messages and responses.

**In summary:**

* `GPT4Chatbot` and `CustomerSupportChatbot` *are* types of `Chatbot` (inheritance).
* `ChatbotFactory` *creates* instances of `GPT4Chatbot` or `CustomerSupportChatbot` (factory pattern).
* `ChatSession` *manages* the interaction between the user and a `Chatbot` (or its subclasses) and stores the history.

### 3.3 Key Algorithms and Data Structures Implemented

* **GPT-4 API Interaction:**
    * The `GPT4Chatbot` class uses the `requests` library to send a POST request to the GPT-4 API.
    * The request includes the user's message, the API key, and other parameters.
    * The API returns a JSON response, from which the chatbot's response is extracted.
* **Rule-Based Response Selection:**
    * The `CustomerSupportChatbot` class uses a series of conditional statements to determine if the user's message matches any predefined keywords or patterns.
    * Upon a match, the corresponding response is returned.
* **Chat History Management:**
    * The `ChatSession` class uses a list (`self._history`) to store the history of messages and responses.
    * The history is stored as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing the user's message and the chatbot's response.
* **Data Structures:**
    * The application primarily uses Python lists and dictionaries.
    * The `conversation_history` in the `GPT4Chatbot` class is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message in the conversation.
    * The `headers` attribute in the `GPT4Chatbot` class is a dictionary that stores the HTTP headers for the API request.
    * JSON is employed to serialize and deserialize the chat history when saving to and loading from a file.
